# Programming Language Concepts - Lexer And Parser
Creating the Lexer, Parser, and Compiler Classes for a programming language.

## Assignment Checklist
- [ ] Develop a class/struct for Token (contains string for lexeme representation and int for token code)
- [ ] Develop a Compiler class with a method that takes a file and converts it into one input str
- [ ] Develop a Lexer Class that contains and recognizes certain tokens for literals, keywords, special symbols, and variables
- [ ] Develop a Parser Class that creates a parse tree of statements (code blocks, selection, loop, assignment, and declaration)
- [ ] Use Denotational semantics to define your selection statement
- [ ] Use Denotational Semantics to define your loop statement
- [ ] Use Denotational Semantics to define your Expr Statement
- [ ] Use Denotation Semantics to redefine your Expr Statement so it can return a Boolean Solution
- [ ] Define the attribute grammar for your assignment statment
- [ ] Choose 3 syntactically valid assignment statements to show rules failing or passing semantic rules
- [ ] Find the weakest precondition in Axiomatic Semantics
